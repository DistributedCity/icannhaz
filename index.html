        Wish there was an easy to use alternate domain name system? Where the domain names are controlled by their
        owners and not the government?
        Wish you could have a domain name that can never be seized?
        Owned and controlled by you with no renewal fees for life?

        <span class="coolio-blurb">You got questions, I got answers!

    <ul class="code-bullets">

        <li>
            <span class="code">What platforms does this run on?</span> -
            This first alpha release runs on Linux and Windows. OS X is being tested and works fine, just not packaged
            for released yet.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="code">Can I use this in Opera or Chrome or IE?</span> -
            We made the system plug and play for Firefox. Once it is running in Firefox you can use other browsers if
            you set them up in a special way.
            Beyond the scope of this FAQ.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="code">Isn't this the same thing as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MafiaaFire_Redirector">MafiaaFire</a> Browser Plugin?</span> -
            Haha. Not quite. MaffiaaFire was a nice try, and credit to them for their effort. That system is still
            centralized turning MafiaaFire plugin
            developers into a backup centralized DNS system. Namecoin and the Icanhazz.bit system is fully distributed,
            encrypted, digitally signed p2p infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="code">What does the plugin do technically?</span> -
            Well not to get technical but it runs a namecoin client, a node.js DNS server, a node.js SOCKS proxy server,
            and redirects .bit domain requests through the
            local proxy doing internal .bit lookups and letting you use the browser as normal.
        </li>
